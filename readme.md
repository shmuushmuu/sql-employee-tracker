  ## Description of Project
  Using MySQL and Inquirer, I created a database that held departments, roles, and employees within a company. This allows admins to view and add employees, and see necessary information in the tables of the database.

  ## Installation Instructions
  Open the terminal in your directory for this file, and run "npm i".
  After that, open MySQL with "mysql -uroot". In MySQL, run the following two lines in this order: "source db/schema.sql;" followed by "source db/seeds.sql;". This will set up the database that I created as an example. If you would like to interact with that database, run "node server.js" in the terminal and enjoy the prompts!
